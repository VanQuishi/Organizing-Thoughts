# Organizing-Thoughts

You are an unnamed TA attending Professor Rizk’s meeting. She always catches you
getting distracted so she decides to make you write a program for her to sort out
your thoughts whenever she catches you on your phone. You may have a short
attention span but you are a clever TA. Your students are free labor. You will get
them to write their program for you or you will fail them and Professor Rizk will never
ever find out.

Professor Rizk is so cool -> Huh? What did Professor Rizk say?
-> Say something she is getting mad -> Neck on froze (huh huh)
-> Cool A/C air blowing down my neck

This is your train of thought. They are linked together. Normally, the last sentence of
one thought should be the first sentence of the next consecutive thought. However,
these thoughts are scrambled up. This is what it looks like when you sort out your
thoughts.

Professor Rizk is so cool -> Cool A/C air blowing down my neck
-> Neck on froze (huh huh) -> Huh? What did Profesor Rizk say?
-> Say something she is getting mad

During lab, you will give your students a text files containing your
thoughts and they will output your thoughts in a connected, sorted
order.
